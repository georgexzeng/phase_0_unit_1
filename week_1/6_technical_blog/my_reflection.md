Blog url: http://georgexzeng.github.io/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

<p>	Yes I enjoyed this!  I found the blog to be helpful for my learning.  I unfortunately found that the key drivers of my favorite styles are content and not style.  However, with good content, I appreciate a style that stays out of the way. </p>
