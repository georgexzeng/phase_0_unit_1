## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

Creating a new repo on GitHub is simple:
1. click on the "Repositories" button

3. click on the HTTPS clone url button
4. go to the place where you want to save it in the terminal; type in git clone HTTPS CLONE URL
5. do a happy dance

* Describe what open source means
Open source shares a program's source code and allows anyone to customize the software as they seem fit

* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
Open Source feels like utopia.  It seems like the exact kind of thing that pushes progress and innovation forward.  I'd love to be a part of great open source projects

* Assess the importance of using licenses
Licenses seem important because copyright is automatic in the US - and specifying open source licensing allows otherp eople to help you

* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
This challenge was still relatively simple


* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
