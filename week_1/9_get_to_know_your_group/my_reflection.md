Hey Guys!  Sorry my work is coming late.  I didn't officially join until late this week, so I'm playing a bit of catch-up.  Still tweaking around now.  Won't happen next week!
Location
Another Philly-ite! I spend a lot of time in NYC too though (next three weekends, etc.).  
Favorite websites
Hacker News.  Farnam Street Blog.  Spotify.  My real favorite sites also include Reddit, etc. I realize all these sites were news sites that are terrible  to analyze.  
Gregorc Thinking Style
I'm a total abstract sequential.  
Learning style (Visual, Aural, Kinesthetic, Multimodal)
Aural (musically inclined person), Reading/writing (read a lot), Kinesthetic (uh...I gues I also breakdance?)

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.

<p>I feel a stronger sense of unity knowing that other people are going through the same experience I'm going through.  I know I have a tedency to want to run ahead, even if by myself, and hearing the culture talk as well as reading other people's reactions to the culture gave me more pause and restraint in how far and quickly I should take things.  It was a good reminder of the need to pace myself.</p>
