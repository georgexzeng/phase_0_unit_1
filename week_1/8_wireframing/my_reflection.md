## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
<p>I love design - it's a lot more interesting to be able to solve problems by observing and immersing yourself in a problem, contemplating the solutions and then iterating before you find amazing solutions. </p>
<p>In a way - I feel this isn't just design - this is the basic problem solving process relevant to any problem in our lives.</p>

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
<p>It is a lot of fun workin gon my site!  I plan on continuing to tweak and refine things over time - to maximize the aesthetics and useability of the site.</p>

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
<p>Some of my questions had to do with how exactly can I design something that is both beautiful and highly functional?   I looked at the designs of other websites, but I also referenced design books like Dieter Rams's Less and More.</p>


* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
<p>Nothing too crazy so far.</p>

* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
<p>Lots of interesting ideas around CSS, HTML and design.</p>

* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
<p>Pretty confident - this overlaps a little with some design work I played around with before.</p>

* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
<p>The designing of a site.  The coding of the prodcut.  The enjoyment of a (hopefully) beautiful looking end product.  </p>

* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
<p>Going through each individual step of a process - I understand it's necessary, but sometimes I just want to jump into the design and code!</p>
