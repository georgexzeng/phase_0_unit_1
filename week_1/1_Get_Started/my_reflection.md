## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
I unfortunately don't have much to write here - I set up git and GitHub earlier in playing around with front end coding so not too much to report here.  However, my main takeaway is that working in git for a beginner can be a challenge given its reliance on the command line.  It's not intellectually hard but does require a fair amount of memorization


* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
Git is a sotware system for tracking version changes; GitHub is a cloud based system to track version changes amongst many different people.  Git is to GitHub as is saving different versions of a document on flashdrives is to Dropbox.  

* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it. 
Version control allows a person to see all the edits that have happened over time and who made them.  GitHub helps with this by storing all the code online, allowing people to see the changes in code over time, and to comment on them.  

* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
Devs use version control (git) so they can keep track of code over time.  Git makes a ton of sense to me given that programs are such large amalgamations of code - someone has to go about properly tracking this over time.  

* What doesn't make sense? What does?
Social coding makes sense.  The only way to potentially do this better would be to (1) have an editor integrated with social coding and (2) allow real time coding changes to happen directly in github, so pair programming can happen real time.
