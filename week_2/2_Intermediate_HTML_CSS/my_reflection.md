# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
<p>Web standards are not only good - they're absolutely necessary.  Otherwise there would be a ton of time and friction by different programmers and browsers in figuring out what's the right way of representing different styles on a website.  </p>

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
<p>Standard structure makes a ton of sense to me - in structuring things as divs, etc.  However, I like the new HTML5 elements better in that they're quicker to use.</p>

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
<p>I like the new HTML5 elements better because they make things a lot more quicker to type and work through.</p>

* Why is reset.css necessary? 
<p>Reset.css is necessary to reset the actual formats and preferences for a browser's default settings.</p>

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
<p>I use almost exclusively Chrome, with Firefox on occassion.  I think it's annoying that different sites look different in different browsers.  Taking the time to make sure that sites work in different browsers sound mostly like a waste of time.</p>
