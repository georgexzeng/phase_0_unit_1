        <h2>Why pair program?</h2>
        <!--<img src = "http://pairprogrammingisfun.com/images/header.jpg">-->
        <p>Pair programming is the fine art of programming with another fine human being.
            It makes programming both more enjoyable as well as more educational.  Programming
            can be lonely if done exclusively by oneself, and having another voice in the void 
            of cyberspace can make time pass more quickly.  In addition, pair programming can
            help a hacker discover unknowns unknowns as well as help her/him understand concepts
            through explaining it to another person. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>What is a navigator?</h2>
        <img src = "http://www.modifiedplanet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/car-photo-skoda-funny-car-multiple-windshield-mounted-navigation-gps.jpg">
        
        <p>A navigator is a person in a pair programming pair that dictates the features and structure of
            a program.  In a way, a driver helps direct the macro strategy and direction of the program
            as it is being built.
        </p>
        
        <h2>What is a driver?</h2>
        <img src = "http://www.pichkoo.com/funzone/fun-pics/dog-driver.jpg">
        
        <p>A driver actually does the typing within a program.  Going along with our previous analogy, a driver
            directs the micro nitty gritty of the exact syntax and code format of a program.
