Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
<p>I learn that although I have the instinct to just jump in and start coding right away, spending some time thinking about design is helpful for longer term planning.  I also realize I like coding and building websites in phases.  Some planning and coming out with a MVP version of a website.  Than some additional planning to refine v2 of the site.  Rinse and repeat.  </p>


* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
<p>It was fun working on the design and user experience of the site!  I'm still trying to figure out how to make the functionality of the blog work...</p>

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
<p>My process was I first designed a v1.0 of the website landing page.  I then coded up v1.0.  Next I designed v2.0 of the website.  The design process has worked well so far - I just haven't quite figured out how to add blogging funcitonality into my site yet though.  I've been playing around with blogging gems, but this may be starting to cheat - I want to make sure I don't go down the path of being a copy and paste coder.</p>

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
<p>Adding blogging capabilities.</p>

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
<p>I started playing around with how gems work - I think that's really neat!</p>


* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
