# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?

<p>Document object model allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content and structure of websites.  This makes a ton of sense to me - because instead of having just static HTML pages - with dynamics HTML, pages, we can add a lot more interactivity into a website, that will allow for actual web applicatiosn to built.  The negative side of the DOM model seems to be that it increases both the complexity and the load time of web pages - however, in the long run, this seems like a small price to pay for more interacitivty.</p>

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?

<p>Right now my site is super bare bones and simple.  A wordpress.com site, by comparison - has a lot more content and complexity</p>

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?

<p>I found Chrome Web Tools to be both fun and incredibly helpful.  Having something where you can real time change the HTML, CSS, or javascript of a website is incredibly powerful.  Also being able to quickly modify the speed and optimization of a site strikes me as incredibly useful.</p>

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

<p>The biggest aha moments had to do with just how powerful Developer Tools are and the neat things we can use it for, in terms of prototyping, experimentation and in actual development.</p>

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
