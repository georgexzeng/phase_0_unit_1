# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
<p>I think responsive web design is great - I like it a lot because done right, I think you can intelligently design a website for multiple platforms at the same time.  I think designing for mobile responsiveness is critical - given more and more access of pages is now happening on cell phones and tablets.</p>


* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
<p>I think smartphones and tablest have made web design more complicated.  Instead of designing for one screen, now we have to design for almost an infinite number of screens.  The way to do this is probably with a grid system and with fonts that automatically reset according to the screen size.  </p>


* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
<p>Visually impaired people should use the web - everyone should use the web in this day and age.  We should design and develop for them as well - I don't think it'd be really possible to go through life without having acess to websites and the internet in general.  I think the way to do this, again, is to have a combination of human centric design - as well as software tools that allow visualy impaired people to enlarge fonts and websites.</p>


* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
<p>Universally responsive design resonates very deeply with me - I don't think we should customize a site every time we work on it.  I think with some kind of template site, we should be able to design for every kind of screen at the same time, immediately.</p>
