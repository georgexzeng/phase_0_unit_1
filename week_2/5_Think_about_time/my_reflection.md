# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
<p>I haven't had big challenges with time management in Phase 0 so far - but my biggest concerns have to do with time boxing and avoiding distractions. </p>

* How will you combat that? 
<p>The biggest way I'm combating this is by utilizing the pomodoro technique and by listening to good house music while coding.</p>

* What techniques will you try?
<p>Pomodoro timer technique has been very helpful!</p>


* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
<p>My overall plan for Phase 0 is to sprint ahead as quickly as possible; I know I personally learn better by working on projects.  So I hope to finish the materials as quickly as possible so I can begin hacking on side projects.  In addition, I'm planning on traveling to Seoul, Taipei, Singapore, and Tokyo in the week or two before DBC begins - so having everything completed would be very nice!</p>
