// My role in the group is:

// Relase 0: Person 1 (George Zeng)

// Here is my part of the challenge:

// Test 1:
// For the first test, we want to add up all of the numbers in a list and 
// return this value.


// Test 2:
// For the second test, we want to add up all of numbers in a list and divide
// this sum by the amount of numbers.  Return this value after these two steps are done.

// Test 3:
// For the third test, we want to find the number that is directly in the middle
// of a list, for a list with an odd amount of numbers.  If the list has an odd amount of numbers,
// we want to find the average of the two middlemost numbers.  Return this value after these steps are done.
